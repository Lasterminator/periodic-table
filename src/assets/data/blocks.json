            "description": "The s-block encompasses the first two columns on the left side of the periodic table, including nonmetals hydrogen and helium, alkali metals (group 1), and alkaline earth metals (group 2). Their electron configuration is typically ns1â€“2. Helium, while an s-element, is placed in group 18 next to neon. S-block metals are generally soft with low melting and boiling points, often imparting color to flames. Chemically, s-elements (excluding helium) are highly reactive and tend to form ionic compounds with nonmetals."
